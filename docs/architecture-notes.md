```

Browser runtime code lives in `src/`, TypeScript extraction tools live in
`scripts/`, and build/coverage scripts live in `scripts/`. Vite bundles `src/`
into `dist/assets/` for production.

## Root-Level Contract

- **The HTML entry file is part of the runtime contract**: `index.html` is
  referenced by `vite.config.ts`, Playwright tests, and the browser runtime.
  Moving or renaming it is a route change.
- **Toolchain configs belong at the root**: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`,
  `playwright.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.browser.json`, and
  `.nycrc.json` are loaded from the workspace root by their respective tools.
- **Generated artifact folders are disposable**: `dist/`, `coverage/`,
  `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, and `.nyc_output/` are not
  hand-maintained source folders.
- **Generated artifact locations are hard-coded**: moving them requires
  coordinated edits in `.gitignore`, `.nycrc.json`, `playwright.config.ts`,
  `scripts/test-coverage.ts`, and `tests/baseFixtures.ts`.

## Build and Runtime Flow

`npm run serve` starts the Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

`npm run build` runs the Vite production build to `dist/`.

`npm run test` runs Playwright tests against `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
If that Vite dev server is already running, Playwright reuses it; otherwise it
starts Vite itself on port 3000 with `--strictPort`.

`npm run test:coverage` executes `scripts/test-coverage.ts`, which:

1. Cleans `.nyc_output/` and `coverage/`.
2. Runs Playwright tests with `VITE_COVERAGE=true` to enable Istanbul
   instrumentation via `vite-plugin-istanbul`.
3. Generates nyc coverage reports (text, HTML, LCOV, JSON summary).
4. Enforces per-file coverage thresholds (currently 80%).

`npm run typecheck` checks all four TypeScript projects separately:
`tsconfig.json` (Node/tools), `tsconfig.browser.json` (browser runtime in
`src/`), `tsconfig.config.json` (root config files), and `tsconfig.test.json`
(test files).

`npm run validate` runs typecheck, Vitest unit tests with coverage, and
markdownlint.

## Browser UI Contract

The app is a single-page application with two states:

### Home Page

- Centered hero with app logo, title (`eJay Sound Browser`), description,
  folder-picker button, and optional dev-library shortcut.
- A **BPM filter** dropdown sits at the bottom-right of the home area
  (persists into the main view once a library is loaded).

### Main App View (after loading a library)

The product-list and table-based sample views are replaced by a single
sequencer-inspired layout:

- **Left sidebar** — A vertical two-column grid of **category buttons**
  (one button per top-level channel such as Bass, Drum, Effect, etc.).
  Clicking a category button selects it and populates the subcategory
  tabs and sample grid.
- **Top tab bar** — A horizontal row of **subcategory tabs** scoped to
  the active category. A `+` button at the end allows adding or
  importing new subcategory groupings.
- **Main grid** — A sequencer-style grid of **sample blocks** arranged
  in rows. Each row represents a channel/lane; each block represents
  a sample that can be previewed or placed.
- **BPM filter** — A dropdown control for filtering samples by tempo.

### Terminology

- In browser-facing UI, `Category` means the extracted sample-group/folder
  classification (shown in the sidebar). `Subcategory` is the finer
  grouping shown as tabs within a category.
- Audio `channels` still refers to mono/stereo metadata in `metadata.json`.

## Language Constraints

- **TypeScript for browser and build tooling** — all `src/`, `scripts/`, and
  `tests/` code is `.ts`.
- **TypeScript for offline tooling** — the `scripts/` directory contains batch
  extraction, catalog, analysis, and MIX-parser utilities run via `tsx`. These
  files are not part of the browser runtime or build pipeline.
- **No runtime database** — extracted audio metadata is served as static JSON
  files from `output/`.

## UI and Style Documentation

See [style-guide.md](style-guide.md) for the DaisyUI theme tokens, channel
color palette, typography, component anatomy, layout rules, and responsive
behavior.

The live source of truth is the code in `src/app.css` and the renderer modules
under `src/`. If documentation drifts, the code wins and the style guide should
be updated.

## Editing Guidelines

- **Extracted data lives in `output/<product>/`**: `metadata.json` plus WAV
  files in channel subfolders. These are generated by `scripts/pxd-parser.ts` and
  `scripts/reorganize.ts` — do not hand-edit.
- **Source data is read-only**: never modify files under `archive/`.
- **Keep MIX format detail in the dedicated reference**:
  `docs/mix-format-analysis.md` is the low-level `.mix` format reference.
  Keep MIX-specific format notes there rather than duplicating them in broader
  project docs.
- **Techno eJay 3 has a verified product-specific override**: the original
  `seiten` file defines a `Sphere` tab, and the `SRC*` bank in `rave30.inf`
  belongs there rather than under `Scratch`.
- **When adding a new browser runtime file**, update the browser file lists in
  `vite.config.ts` (Istanbul `include`), `.nycrc.json` (coverage `include`),
  and `tsconfig.browser.json` (`include`) so instrumentation, reporting, and
  browser type-checking remain aligned.
- **Generated report/temp directories are disposable**: do not treat
  `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.nyc_output/`, or
  `dist/` as hand-maintained source folders.

## Planned: MIX Sample Resolution Translation Layer

When loading a `.mix` file in the browser, sample references emitted by
`src/mix-parser.ts` (`MixIR.sampleRef`-style entries) are currently resolved
directly against `data/index.json` / `output/<product>/metadata.json`. Some
references fail because the original sample lives under a different product
folder (deduplicated by `scripts/find-duplicates.ts`) or under a renamed
filename (`scripts/rename-samples.ts`). Today these failures silently drop
the voice from playback.

This section captures the plan to introduce a dedicated **sample resolution
translation layer** with a tiered fallback strategy and structured logging.

### Goals

- Centralise *every* sample lookup performed by `src/mix-player.ts` (and any
  future MIX consumer) behind a single resolver API.
- Apply a deterministic chain of fallbacks before declaring a sample missing.
- Emit a machine-readable log of unresolved samples so the catalog and
  duplicate database can be improved over time.
- Keep the resolver pure-by-default and unit-testable without a real
  `AudioContext` or filesystem (mirrors the `mix-player.ts` style).

### Resolution Pipeline

For each `(product, channel, filename)` reference requested by the player:

1. **Primary lookup** — exact match in the in-memory catalog built from
   `data/index.json`. This is the existing behaviour.
2. **Duplicate fallback** — if the primary lookup misses, consult a parsed
   index of `logs/duplicates.csv` (keyed by `(product, channel, filename)`
   and by `hash_prefix`). If any duplicate row exists for the same
   `hash_prefix`, return the first row whose target file is present in the
   catalog.
3. **Catalog-wide fallback** — if duplicates do not yield a hit, perform a
   filename-only search across **all** `output/**/metadata.json` entries
   (already aggregated in `data/index.json`). The first match wins; matches
   with the same channel are preferred over cross-channel matches.
4. **Logged miss** — if all three tiers fail, append a row to
   `logs/log.csv` (created on demand) and return `null` so the player can
   skip the voice without throwing.

### Log Format (`logs/log.csv`)

CSV with a stable header so the file can be opened in tooling and diffed in
git:

```csv
timestamp_iso,mix_path,product,channel,filename,reason
```

- `reason` is one of `not_in_catalog`, `not_in_duplicates`,
  `not_in_any_metadata` — emitted at whichever tier produced the final
  miss (always `not_in_any_metadata` for full-pipeline failures, but the
  field is reserved for future per-tier diagnostics).
- Rows are append-only; the resolver de-duplicates within a single load
  session to avoid log spam from a repeated voice.

### New Files

- `src/sample-resolver.ts` — pure resolver: takes a catalog snapshot, a
  parsed duplicates index, and a logger callback; exports a
  `resolveSample(ref): ResolvedSample | null` function plus small helpers
  (`parseDuplicatesCsv`, `buildDuplicateIndex`, `formatLogRow`).
- `src/duplicates-loader.ts` — browser-side fetch + parse for
  `logs/duplicates.csv`. Returns the structured index consumed by
  `sample-resolver.ts`. Kept separate so the resolver itself stays pure.
- `src/miss-logger.ts` — thin abstraction over the log sink. In the
  browser this POSTs (or buffers + downloads) CSV rows; in tests it is
  replaced with an in-memory collector.
- `src/__tests__/sample-resolver.test.ts` — Vitest unit coverage for the
  three-tier pipeline, duplicate index lookup, and log row formatting.

### Touched Existing Files

- `src/mix-player.ts` — replace direct catalog lookups with calls to
  `resolveSample`. Inject the resolver via constructor/factory so tests
  keep using stubs.
- `src/mix-parser.ts` — no behavioural change; only verify that emitted
  `sampleRef` entries carry enough fields (`product`, `channel`,
  `filename`) for the resolver.
- `src/data.ts` — expose the aggregated `data/index.json` view as a
  catalog snapshot the resolver can consume without re-fetching.
- `index.html` / Vite static-asset config — ensure `logs/duplicates.csv`
  is served at runtime (read-only). `logs/log.csv` is **not** shipped;
  it is a developer-side artifact populated by the miss logger.

### Tooling and Tests

- **Build/serve** — `logs/duplicates.csv` becomes a runtime asset. Add it
  to Vite's `publicDir` allow-list (or copy via a build step) without
  enlarging the production bundle.
- **Unit tests** (`npm run test:unit`) — cover the resolver in isolation:
  primary hit, duplicate fallback, catalog-wide fallback, logged miss,
  duplicate row malformed, empty duplicates file, repeated misses
  de-duplicated within a session.
- **Playwright** (`tests/mix-playback.spec.ts`) — add a regression that
  loads a known-good `.mix` whose voices include at least one
  duplicate-only sample, asserting playback proceeds and no
  `not_in_any_metadata` row is produced.
- **Coverage** — `src/sample-resolver.ts`, `src/duplicates-loader.ts`,
  and `src/miss-logger.ts` must each meet the 80% per-cell threshold
  enforced by `scripts/test-coverage.ts`. Add them to the browser
  include lists in `vite.config.ts`, `.nycrc.json`, and
  `tsconfig.browser.json`.

### Out of Scope

- Editing `logs/duplicates.csv` (read-only input produced by
  `scripts/find-duplicates.ts`).
- Mutating any `output/**/metadata.json` file at runtime.
- Persisting `logs/log.csv` from the browser without a developer-driven
  download/POST step (no silent server writes from the SPA).
