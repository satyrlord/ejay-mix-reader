```

Browser runtime code lives in `src/`, TypeScript extraction tools live in
`scripts/`, and build/coverage scripts live in `scripts/`. Vite bundles `src/`
into `dist/assets/` for production.

## Root-Level Contract

- **The HTML entry file is part of the runtime contract**: `index.html` is
  referenced by `vite.config.ts`, Playwright tests, and the browser runtime.
  Moving or renaming it is a route change.
- **Toolchain configs belong at the root**: `package.json`, `vite.config.ts`,
  `playwright.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.browser.json`, and
  `.nycrc.json` are loaded from the workspace root by their respective tools.
- **Generated artifact folders are disposable**: `dist/`, `coverage/`,
  `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, and `.nyc_output/` are not
  hand-maintained source folders.
- **Generated artifact locations are hard-coded**: moving them requires
  coordinated edits in `.gitignore`, `.nycrc.json`, `playwright.config.ts`,
  `scripts/test-coverage.ts`, and `tests/baseFixtures.ts`.

## Build and Runtime Flow

`npm run serve` starts the Vite dev server on `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.

`npm run build` runs the Vite production build to `dist/`.

Before Vite bundles the app, `scripts/build-index.ts` regenerates
`data/index.json`. That step merges recovered embedded-MIX samples into the
browser catalog, enriches each `.mix` entry with parsed `MixFileMeta`, and
includes `_userdata` directories after the product archive groups.

During local development, the Vite server also exposes three project-specific
endpoints:

1. `/mix/<product>/<filename>` — allow-listed access to archived `.mix` files.
2. `PUT /__category-config` — dev-only persistence for `output/categories.json`.
3. `PUT /__sample-move` — dev-only sample moves between category/subcategory
  folders; patches `output/metadata.json` and emits a hot-update event so the
  grid reloads in place.

`npm run test` runs Playwright tests against `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`.
If that Vite dev server is already running, Playwright reuses it; otherwise it
starts Vite itself on port 3000 with `--strictPort`.

`npm run test:coverage` executes `scripts/test-coverage.ts`, which:

1. Cleans `.nyc_output/` and `coverage/`.
2. Runs Playwright tests with `VITE_COVERAGE=true` to enable Istanbul
   instrumentation via `vite-plugin-istanbul`.
3. Generates nyc coverage reports (text, HTML, LCOV, JSON summary).
4. Enforces per-file coverage thresholds (currently 80%).

`npm run typecheck` checks all four TypeScript projects separately:
`tsconfig.json` (Node/tools), `tsconfig.browser.json` (browser runtime in
`src/`), `tsconfig.config.json` (root config files), and `tsconfig.test.json`
(test files).

`npm run validate` runs typecheck, Vitest unit tests with coverage, and
markdownlint.

## Browser UI Contract

The app is a single-page application with two states:

### Home Page

- Centered hero with app logo, title (`eJay Sound Browser`), description,
  folder-picker button, and optional dev-library shortcut.
- A **BPM filter** dropdown sits at the bottom-right of the home area
  (persists into the main view once a library is loaded).

### Main App View (after loading a library)

The browser shell is split into three stacked regions above the fixed transport
bar:

- **Top editor area** — A live `Mix Archive` browser on the left and a
  sequencer/timeline placeholder on the right. In dev mode, the archive tree
  loads from `data/index.json`; in production-style folder picks it prompts for
  an `archive/` root via the File System Access API or a `webkitdirectory`
  fallback. Clicking a `.mix` item opens a metadata popup, but loading the mix
  into the sequencer is still pending.
- **Middle context strip** — Current mix status text plus subcategory tabs,
  sample search input, sample-bubble zoom controls, and the BPM filter.
- **Bottom browser area** — A category sidebar and a lane-based sample grid.
  The sidebar includes regular categories plus system actions such as
  `Unsorted` and `Load JSON`.

Samples are rendered as beat-scaled blocks rather than table rows. The browser
matches search terms against the display name plus the rendered metadata line.
The default sort is descending beat length and then display name, but
right-clicking empty grid space opens a sort menu for name, BPM, sample
length, product, detail, subcategory, and source. Right-clicking a sample
block opens a `Move to` menu; in the dev-server library flow the move is
persisted through `PUT /__sample-move`, while production-style folder picks
apply the change in-memory only.

### Terminology

- In browser-facing UI, `Category` means the extracted sample-group/folder
  classification (shown in the sidebar). `Subcategory` is the finer grouping
  shown as tabs within a category and is sourced from `output/categories.json`
  when available.
- Audio `channels` still refers to mono/stereo metadata in `metadata.json`.

## Language Constraints

- **TypeScript for browser and build tooling** — all `src/`, `scripts/`, and
  `tests/` code is `.ts`.
- **TypeScript for offline tooling** — the `scripts/` directory contains batch
  extraction, catalog, analysis, and MIX-parser utilities run via `tsx`. These
  files are not part of the browser runtime or build pipeline.
- **No runtime database** — extracted audio metadata is served as static JSON
  files from `output/`.

## UI and Style Documentation

See [style-guide.md](style-guide.md) for the DaisyUI theme tokens, channel
color palette, typography, component anatomy, layout rules, and responsive
behavior.

The live source of truth is the code in `src/app.css` and the renderer modules
under `src/`. If documentation drifts, the code wins and the style guide should
be updated.

## Editing Guidelines

- **Browser library data lives in `output/`**: `metadata.json`, optional
  `categories.json`, and WAV files organized into category/subcategory
  folders. These are generated by the extraction/normalization scripts and
  should not be hand-edited unless you are intentionally editing the category
  config during local development.
- **Recovered embedded-MIX provenance lives beside the output library**:
  `output/Unsorted/embedded-mix-audio-manifest.json` is generated by
  `npm run mix:extract-embedded`, and `scripts/build-index.ts` merges it back
  into the browser catalog as synthetic `Embedded MIX` samples.
- **Source data is read-only**: never modify files under `archive/`.
- **Keep MIX format detail in the dedicated reference**:
  `docs/mix-format-analysis.md` is the low-level `.mix` format reference.
  Keep MIX-specific format notes there rather than duplicating them in broader
  project docs.
- **Techno eJay 3 has a verified product-specific override**: the original
  `seiten` file defines a `Sphere` tab, and the `SRC*` bank in `rave30.inf`
  belongs there rather than under `Scratch`.
- **When adding a new browser runtime file**, update the browser file lists in
  `vite.config.ts` (Istanbul `include`), `.nycrc.json` (coverage `include`),
  and `tsconfig.browser.json` (`include`) so instrumentation, reporting, and
  browser type-checking remain aligned.
- **Generated report/temp directories are disposable**: do not treat
  `coverage/`, `playwright-report/`, `test-results/`, `.nyc_output/`, or
  `dist/` as hand-maintained source folders.

## Planned: MIX Sample Resolution Translation Layer

When loading a `.mix` file in the browser, sample references emitted by
`src/mix-parser.ts` (`MixIR.sampleRef`-style entries) are currently resolved
directly against `data/index.json` / `output/<product>/metadata.json`. Some
references fail because the original sample lives under a different product
folder (deduplicated by `scripts/find-duplicates.ts`) or under a renamed
filename (`scripts/rename-samples.ts`). Today these failures silently drop
the voice from playback.

This section captures the plan to introduce a dedicated **sample resolution
translation layer** with a tiered fallback strategy and structured logging.

### Goals

- Centralise *every* sample lookup performed by `src/mix-player.ts` (and any
  future MIX consumer) behind a single resolver API.
- Apply a deterministic chain of fallbacks before declaring a sample missing.
- Emit a machine-readable log of unresolved samples so the catalog and
  duplicate database can be improved over time.
- Keep the resolver pure-by-default and unit-testable without a real
  `AudioContext` or filesystem (mirrors the `mix-player.ts` style).

### Resolution Pipeline

For each `(product, channel, filename)` reference requested by the player:

1. **Primary lookup** — exact match in the in-memory catalog built from
   `data/index.json`. This is the existing behaviour.
2. **Duplicate fallback** — if the primary lookup misses, consult a parsed
   index of `logs/duplicates.csv` (keyed by `(product, channel, filename)`
   and by `hash_prefix`). If any duplicate row exists for the same
   `hash_prefix`, return the first row whose target file is present in the
   catalog.
3. **Catalog-wide fallback** — if duplicates do not yield a hit, perform a
   filename-only search across **all** `output/**/metadata.json` entries
   (already aggregated in `data/index.json`). The first match wins; matches
   with the same channel are preferred over cross-channel matches.
4. **Logged miss** — if all three tiers fail, append a row to
   `logs/log.csv` (created on demand) and return `null` so the player can
   skip the voice without throwing.

### Log Format (`logs/log.csv`)

CSV with a stable header so the file can be opened in tooling and diffed in
git:

```csv
timestamp_iso,mix_path,product,channel,filename,reason
```

- `reason` is one of `not_in_catalog`, `not_in_duplicates`,
  `not_in_any_metadata` — emitted at whichever tier produced the final
  miss (always `not_in_any_metadata` for full-pipeline failures, but the
  field is reserved for future per-tier diagnostics).
- Rows are append-only; the resolver de-duplicates within a single load
  session to avoid log spam from a repeated voice.

### New Files

- `src/sample-resolver.ts` — pure resolver: takes a catalog snapshot, a
  parsed duplicates index, and a logger callback; exports a
  `resolveSample(ref): ResolvedSample | null` function plus small helpers
  (`parseDuplicatesCsv`, `buildDuplicateIndex`, `formatLogRow`).
- `src/duplicates-loader.ts` — browser-side fetch + parse for
  `logs/duplicates.csv`. Returns the structured index consumed by
  `sample-resolver.ts`. Kept separate so the resolver itself stays pure.
- `src/miss-logger.ts` — thin abstraction over the log sink. In the
  browser this POSTs (or buffers + downloads) CSV rows; in tests it is
  replaced with an in-memory collector.
- `src/__tests__/sample-resolver.test.ts` — Vitest unit coverage for the
  three-tier pipeline, duplicate index lookup, and log row formatting.

### Touched Existing Files

- `src/mix-player.ts` — replace direct catalog lookups with calls to
  `resolveSample`. Inject the resolver via constructor/factory so tests
  keep using stubs.
- `src/mix-parser.ts` — no behavioural change; only verify that emitted
  `sampleRef` entries carry enough fields (`product`, `channel`,
  `filename`) for the resolver.
- `src/data.ts` — expose the aggregated `data/index.json` view as a
  catalog snapshot the resolver can consume without re-fetching.
- `index.html` / Vite static-asset config — ensure `logs/duplicates.csv`
  is served at runtime (read-only). `logs/log.csv` is **not** shipped;
  it is a developer-side artifact populated by the miss logger.

### Tooling and Tests

- **Build/serve** — `logs/duplicates.csv` becomes a runtime asset. Add it
  to Vite's `publicDir` allow-list (or copy via a build step) without
  enlarging the production bundle.
- **Unit tests** (`npm run test:unit`) — cover the resolver in isolation:
  primary hit, duplicate fallback, catalog-wide fallback, logged miss,
  duplicate row malformed, empty duplicates file, repeated misses
  de-duplicated within a session.
- **Playwright** (`tests/mix-playback.spec.ts`) — add a regression that
  loads a known-good `.mix` whose voices include at least one
  duplicate-only sample, asserting playback proceeds and no
  `not_in_any_metadata` row is produced.
- **Coverage** — `src/sample-resolver.ts`, `src/duplicates-loader.ts`,
  and `src/miss-logger.ts` must each meet the 80% per-cell threshold
  enforced by `scripts/test-coverage.ts`. Add them to the browser
  include lists in `vite.config.ts`, `.nycrc.json`, and
  `tsconfig.browser.json`.

### Out of Scope

- Editing `logs/duplicates.csv` (read-only input produced by
  `scripts/find-duplicates.ts`).
- Mutating any `output/**/metadata.json` file at runtime.
- Persisting `logs/log.csv` from the browser without a developer-driven
  download/POST step (no silent server writes from the SPA).
